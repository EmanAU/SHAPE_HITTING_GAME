# 🎯 Shape Hitting Game - C++ with SFML

This is a simple 2D arcade-style game developed in **C++** using the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. The player controls a shooter at the bottom of the screen and must destroy falling shapes before they reach the player. The game ends when a shape collides with the player.

This project was developed as part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) semester project**.
